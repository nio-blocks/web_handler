This block is mainly intended for use in conjunction with the `WebJSONHandler` block as the Handler block of the service. It can be configured to behave *exactly* the same as the `WebOutput` block but has some shortcuts and common configuration built in by default.\nMainly, it will automatically add the `Content-Type: application/json` header to the response headers. This can be overridden by adding a different `Content-Type` header in the block config.\nThe block also has a convenient default for the `Response Body` config which will write the non-hidden attributes of the signal to the response.\nThis block, along with the `WebJSONHandler` block, should be used if you find yourself having to dive into the `$body` of the standard request signal more often that you would like. It is also useful for building a response object through DynamicFields or similar blocks.",
